            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>Ideally, I got ideas from current social media trends. The goal was to engage students! Interviews, skits, etc. Naturally, a lot of doomscrolling was at play...</p>
            <p>Some ideas were showcasing student projects, while others were announcements for student events.</p>
            <p>I made a document that detailed tags, publish dates, and a general idea of what would be in the video.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="video">
            <h2>Video</h2>
            <p>After 'writing' the video, it basically involved 'whatever worked for the shot.' Not much planning here, really.</p>
            <p>On the fly, if things didn't work, I would just have to switch it up.</p>
            <p>I took an approach similar to <a href="den24.html">DEN24's</a> editingâ€” zoomer-esque, brainrot, maximalist editing. Things had to be fast both for comedy and engagement. (I am so sorry.)</p>
        </section>
        <section id="logistics">
            <h2>Logistics</h2>
            <p>With my coordinator, I made a collaborative Google Workspace with a spreadsheet, detailing what and when to publish.</p>
            <p>Whenever videos would be made, I emailed my coordinator to let them know that (simultaneous) publishing was ready. (I only had access to the TikTok for uploading.)</p>
            <p>Additionally, before shooting, I was required to have participants sign a photo release form.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Criticism">
            <h2>Criticism</h2>
            <p>Like with DEN24, I spent too much time editing on bespoke software. Using the built-in tools would've been much better for this type of video. (Though it still looked great!)</p>
            <p>More 'off the cuff' videos would've been good. Just doing literally whatever sticked would've been more 'authentic.'</p>
            <p>Overall, not bad, but there was a lot of room for improvement.</p>
